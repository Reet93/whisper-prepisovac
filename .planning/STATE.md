# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-28)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: i18n and `get_resource_path()` must exist before any widget code — Phase 1 prerequisite
- Init: UI/UX design contract via /gsd:ui-phase required before coding UI (Phases 1, 2, 3 have UI hint)
- Init: Parallel GPU workers must be capped to 1 (VRAM contention) — UX for communicating this TBD in Phase 3
- Init: macOS codesigning scope (internal vs Apple Developer ID) must be resolved before Phase 4 planning

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3: Claude structured output prompt design (`_upraveno.txt` format) is a spike — needs prompt engineering before coding begins
- Phase 4: macOS codesigning decision (internal distribution vs Apple Developer ID) changes scope by 2-3 days; resolve before Phase 4 planning
- Phase 2: VAD library choice (silero-vad ~50 MB vs webrtcvad C extension) affects packaging size; decide during Phase 2 planning
- Phase 2: MPS operator coverage probe for Apple Silicon needs validation on actual hardware
